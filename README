        46d3233 FDC fix 8/10 (Hervé Poussineau): - Replaces bootsel field by the whole tdr register. It may be easier if we want to later add support for tapes.
        7737052 FDC fix 7/10 (Hervé Poussineau): - Removes useless fields in fdrive_t structure. - Adds a message when bdrv_read/bdrv_write calls fail. - Rename int_status to status0. - Replace some constants by value names.
        b9b3d22 FDC fix 6/10 (Hervé Poussineau): - Stores controller state in MSR register instead of internal state field. This simplifies the fdctrl_read_main_status() function, which may be called in some tight loops.
        1c346df FDC fix 5/10 (Hervé Poussineau): - Better handling of DOR register. DOR register drives external motors, but it not limited to existing drives. - Use FD_DOR_nRESET flag instead of internal FD_CTRL_RESET flag. - Support writing to DOR register even in reset mode (as said in specification)
        368df94 FDC fix 4/10 (Hervé Poussineau): - Handles correctly FD_MSR_NONDMA/FD_DOR_NONDMA flags, and uses them when possible. Fixes a problem with SPECIFY command.

        746d6de FDC fix 2/10 (Hervé Poussineau): - Extract seeking to next sector handling in a function. Add a sector seek in PIO read and write modes
        678803a FDC fix 1/12 (Hervé Poussineau): - Adds a command lookup table, as suggested by Fabrice at http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2008-04/msg00143.html - This also moves initialization functions at the bottom of the file to prevent multiple forward declarations.

This also avoid hardcoding the IRQ callback in the OpenPIC controller, making it more easily reusable and allowing cascading.
